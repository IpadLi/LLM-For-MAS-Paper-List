# LLMs for Multi-Agent Systems

## News
- [2023/10/22] We create this repository to maintain a paper list on LLMs for MASs.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied to various real-world applications. Particularly, LLMs as agents have been adopted in multi-agent systems (MASs) to collaborate or compete with other agents or humans, demonstrating their amazing ability to solve real-world multi-agent problems. In this repository, we track the latest progress in LLMs for MASs and list the papers on various topics related to this field.
